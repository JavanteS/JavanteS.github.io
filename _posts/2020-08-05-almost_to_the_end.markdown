I can't believe that I made it to graduation. For years, I've been wanting to pursue this path but I was too scared(I guess) to start. Before, I was doing what everyone thought was good for me instead of doing what I WANTED to do. I'm so glad I did, I had a great time in this program. I went from writing bits of codes to building functional applications. My cohort and the technical coaches are pretty amazing and helped me my not fling my laptop when I'm stuck on a problem. Â Some of the labs can be quite tricky and it really helps to get someone to look over your work. 


I'm excited but also anxious. After this program, I have to go job-hunting and that is a whole another beast to deal with. Still, I'm going to remain positive for the future. When I get that interview, I won't be this guy anymore.
