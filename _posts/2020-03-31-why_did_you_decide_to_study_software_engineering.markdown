I've been wanting to study this subject for years because it was something I can *get*. It clicked with me when other subjects didn't. However, I didn't believe that I could do this professionally because I felt like I wasn't intelligent enough to hang with the others. So, I started coding here and there in my free time. After a recent job failure, I decided now is the time to start. This is a little(okay, a lot!) scary for me but also exciting.
